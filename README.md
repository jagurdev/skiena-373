# Steven Skiena's CSE 373 - Analysis of Algorithms
My self study of Skiena's 373 as taught in Fall 2021/2020.

## Motivation
- This course teaches from Skiena's [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.algorist.com). This textbook is the recommended resource for learning algorithms and data structures by [teachyourselfcs](https://teachyourselfcs.com).
- Fall 2021 seems like the last year Skiena taught 373 at Stony Brook University. Although his in-person [lecures for Fall 2021](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOtl7M3yp-DXbHTFe_w9zFPXeau28CDao&si=9sP_dYlu9Ypm_qzJ) are available on his YouTube channel, his [Fall 2020 Zoom lectures](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOtl7M3yp-DX6ic0HGT0PUX_wiNmkWkXx&si=ak0_uBCCLNml95TM) seem more appropriate for self-study.
